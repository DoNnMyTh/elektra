#### What is Audit Log?

Audit Log provides an audit trail or change log for Converged Cloud services.

It records audit-relevant activities and stores them in a project-specific journal. In the journal, each recorded activity is represented by an audit event. The event describes the performed activity, the outcome and lastly the resources that are affected.

This service is not just for auditors! Use it to conduct a root-cause analysis when you run into configuration issues (e.g. downtimes). With the information of the audit events, it is much easier to separate human error from platform malfunctions.
