/*
  We are using SASS!
  DO NOT USE require, require_tree, and require_self.

  Instead require further sass files by calling the "@import" directive.
  e.g. @import "mixins";

  Dashboard encapsulates plugin's css in a class with the same name as plugin.
  If the name of your plugin is identity then all css classes inside identity plugin 
  will be surrounded with .identity.
  e.g. .test { color: red; } becomes to .identity .test { color: red; }
  The content div gets also a css class with the name of current plugin. So your styles are 
  effective inside the content of your plugin.
