      Maia is a multi-tenant OpenStack-service for accessing metrics and alarms collected 
      through Prometheus. It offers a Prometheus-compatible API and supports federation.
    %p It contains the following components:
    %ul
      %li

          = link_to 'Maia Service', 'https://github.com/sapcc/maia/blob/master/docs/operators-guide.md', target:'_blank'
        %p
          The service is depending on an existing* Prometheus installation that is responsible 
          for collecting metrics. These metrics are exposed by Maia using the same, familiar
          Prometheus API. The only difference is that all API requests have to be authenticated and
          scoped using either OpenStack identity tokens or basic authentication.
      %li

        %p 
          The maia command can also be used to retrieve metrics from the Maia service. 
          It behaves like any other OpenStack CLI, supporting the same command line options and
          environment variables for authentication

          this is a Prometheus expression browser adapted to Maia. You can use it to discover metrics,
          series and perform ad-hoc queries leveraging all of PromQL's rich query syntax.
