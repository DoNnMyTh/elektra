#### Notification Methods

See all available notification methods. You can search by in name, description, expression and metric.

Notification methods are resources used to specify a notification name, type and address that notifications 
can be sent to. After a notification method has been created, it can be associated with actions in alarm definitions,
such that when an alarm state transition occurs (ok, alarm, undetermined), one or more notifications can be sent.
