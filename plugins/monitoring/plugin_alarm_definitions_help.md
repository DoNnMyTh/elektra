#### Alarm Definitions

See all Alarms definitions. You can search by in name, description, expression and metric.

Alarm Definitions are policies that specify how Alarms should be created. By using Alarm Definitions, 
the user doesn't have to create individual alarms for each system or service. Instead, a small number 
of Alarm Definitions can be managed and Monasca will create Alarms for systems and services as they appear.
