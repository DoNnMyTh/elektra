    %strong Note:
    your project administrators has the possibility to exceed their approved quota manually using the 
    OpenStack API. So it is possible that the summary of all quotas are higher than the quota
    that was granted by your cloud administrator. If that is the case the
    approved quota will appear as an extra mark on the bar to the left and the overcommit will shown as
    a red striped bar. For this case an automatic alert is issued to your domain administrator.
