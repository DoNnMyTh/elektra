      Project administrators may set their current quota to exceed the approved
      quota.  So it is possible that the summary of all quotas is higher than the
      quota that was granted by your cloud administrator. When that is the
      case, the approved quota will appear as an extra mark on the bar to the
      left, and an automatic alert is issued to your cloud administrator.
