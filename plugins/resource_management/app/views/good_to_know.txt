PROJECT
-------
These bars shown the current resource usage in your project. The total length of each
bar indicates the quota that you have been granted by your domain administrator.

To exceed your approved quota please request more resources from you project administrator.

Note: as a project administrator, it is possible (but not preferred) to set your quota directly 
using the OpenStack API. If you set the current quota to exceed your approved quota, the
approved quota will appear as an extra mark on the bar to the left. For this case an automatic alert 
is issued to your domain administrator.

DOMAIN
------
These bars shown the summarized current quota usage over all projects in this domain. 
The total length of each bar indicates the quota that you have been granted by your cloud administrator.

If you need more resources, you can request a larger quota from your cloud administrator.

Note: your project administrators has the possibility to exceed their approved quota manually using the 
OpenStack API. So it is possible that the summary of all quotas are higher than the quota
that was granted by your cloud administrator. If that is the case the
approved quota will appear as an extra mark on the bar to the left and the overcommit will shown as
a red striped bar (a automatic alert is issued to your cloud administrator).

CLOUD
-----
These bars shown the summarized resource usage over all projects in this cloud. 
The total length of each bar shows the real capacity. Capacity can be limited by real 
physlical limits (like RAM or Cores) or, if they are no real limits, it will be 
unlimited (like Instances or Security Groups).
