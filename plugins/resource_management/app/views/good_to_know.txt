PROJECT (alternate variant)
-------

These bars show the current resource usage in your project. The total length of each
bar indicates the quota that you have been granted by your domain administrator.
If you need more resources, you can request a larger quota from your domain
administrator.

As a project administrator, you can also set your quota directly using the
OpenStack API. If you set the current quota to exceed your approved quota, the
approved quota will appear as an extra mark on the bar to the left, and an
automatic alert might be issued to your domain administrator.
