## What is project masterdata?
A project’s masterdata contains different pieces of information about the project. 
The information provided in the “Cost Object” section is necessary for billing purposes. 
The information in the other sections helps CCloud operations and support find the correct
contact persons in case of incidents, problems or questions about the project and indicates
the importance of the project for your operations so that priorities can be set correctly
in case of larger incidents (where e.g. it is important to fix productive systems before
development systems).
